\chapter{Theory / Algorithms}
Describe the algorithms you evaluated. The \textit{algorithmic} flow
of your work should be clear after this chapter. Do not talk much
about the resulting hardware architecture as this is a different topic
(next chapter)! If you performed any number precision evaluations put
them in this chapter as well.
